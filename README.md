## Securing IoT devices in Smart Homes
### Jaime Rankins
This project will give a deep understanding of the risks of IoT devices in smart homes. People may think these devices are very efficient and useful, but they do not know the risks and vulnerabilites behind them. I will be conducting a survey for my classmates to ask their background on these devices, and even if they own any as well.
